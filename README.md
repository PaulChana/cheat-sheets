# Cheatsheets

This repo includes a bunch of tips, tricks and cheat-sheets for things that I want to remember. It is quick and dirty and I make no promises that any of it works fully or properly or is using the best code  standards.

## Standards

* All filenames should be kebab case
* All files are md
* Directory names should be single words, lowercase
* Tags are lowercase
