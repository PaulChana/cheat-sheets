# How to load the Diana mini successfully

The MINI is **NOT** an easy camera to use. She's not easy to load, shoot, advance, rewind, get processed, or make prints from. Every step has some potential to screw up. People like to refer to the MINI as a "toy" camera, but this is not a beginner's camera.  
  
When you load the film, make sure that it is full engaged in the take-up spool. If it's not, it can slip off of the little "tooth" on the take-up spool and get bunched up in there. That's one thing that causes the sprocket holes to get ripped up.   
  
Make sure that the film is tight and flat and that the sprockets are properly engaging the sprocket holes in the film before you close the pressure plate. If the sprockets are not properly engaging the sprocket holes when you close the pressure plate, this can also rip the film when you wind on.  
  
Make sure you operate the shutter before you replace the back. This is what resets the counter. Many MINI users think they have a broken counter, but the problem is simply that they don't fire the shutter with the back off to reset it.  
  
After you've carefully loaded the film and fired the shutter, you should carefully replace the back. It's a common mistake to not make sure that the back is all the way on and locked. If it's not completely engaged and locked, it might fall off and you might get massive light leaks.  
  
After you've carefully replaced the back, you should make sure that the film is tight in the canister. I like to "rewind" the film without pressing the rewind button until I feel some resistance. This is just to make sure the film is tight in the canister. This keeps tension on the film which keeps it flat and keeps it from bunching up which can tear the sprocket holes.  
  
After you're sure it's loaded properly, and the back is secure, you should decide which format you want to shoot in - square-frame or half-frame. You can only switch **after you're fired the shutter** and **before you wind on to the next frame.** You cannot switch modes after you've wound on to the next frame. If you force it, you will break the mechanism and cause all kinds of grief for yourself. If you switch modes in the middle of a roll, you will completely flummox most mini-lab techs. If you screw up and wind on to the next frame before you switched modes, you can handle this by covering the lens with your hand, firing the trigger, and now changing the mode.  
  
So, by now you've carefully loaded the film, replaced the back, and set your shooting mode. Now, you should fire two blank shots to get to some fresh unexposed film. That means you'll always start with the counter on two or three. Don't let that confuse you. Just cover the lens with your hand, fire the shutter, and advance one complete frame until it stops. Then, do that again.  
  
Finally, you're ready to shoot. Have fun.
